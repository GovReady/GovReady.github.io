      Anyone who works with government IT systems knows the challenge of Federal Information Security Management Act certification and accreditation.
    </p>
    <p class="text-left">
      We sure do. We have the scars.
    </p>
    <p class="text-left">
      The FIPS-199's. The NIST 800-53's. The back and forth (and back and forth) with Security. The months long wait for sign off. System Security Plans three hundred pages long. Last minute code changes for ATO's and POA&amp;M's. Waiting for FedRamp. We've waded through the red tape.  We've cried over tools we couldn't use.
