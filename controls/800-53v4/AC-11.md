<blockquote>
<pre>     The information system: 
      (AC-11a.) Prevents further access to the system by initiating a session lock after [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of inactivity or upon receiving a request from a user; and 
      (AC-11b.) Retains the session lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification and authentication procedures.
