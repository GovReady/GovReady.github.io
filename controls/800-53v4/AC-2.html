<blockquote>
<pre>     The organization: 
      (AC-2a.) Identifies and selects the following types of information system accounts to support organizational missions/business functions: [Assignment: organization-defined information system account types]; 
      (AC-2b.) Assigns account managers for information system accounts; 
      (AC-2c.) Establishes conditions for group and role membership; 
      (AC-2d.) Specifies authorized users of the information system, group and role membership, and access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each account; 
      (AC-2e.) Requires approvals by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] for requests to create information system accounts; 
      (AC-2f.) Creates, enables, modifies, disables, and removes information system accounts in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined procedures or conditions]; 
      (AC-2g.) Monitors the use of information system accounts; 
      (AC-2h.) Notifies account managers: 
        (AC-2h.1.) When accounts are no longer required; 
        (AC-2h.2.) When users are terminated or transferred; and 
        (AC-2h.3.) When individual information system usage or need-to-know changes; 
      (AC-2i.) Authorizes access to the information system based on: 
        (AC-2i.1.) A valid access authorization; 
        (AC-2i.2.) Intended system usage; and 
        (AC-2i.3.) Other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions; 
      (AC-2j.) Reviews accounts for compliance with account management requirements [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and 
      (AC-2k.) Establishes a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group.
