<blockquote>
<pre>     The information system: 
      (AC-8a.) Displays to users [Assignment: organization-defined system use notification message or banner] before granting access to the system that provides privacy and security notices consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance and states that: 
        (AC-8a.1.) Users are accessing a U.S. Government information system; 
        (AC-8a.2.) Information system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit; 
        (AC-8a.3.) Unauthorized use of the information system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and 
        (AC-8a.4.) Use of the information system indicates consent to monitoring and recording; 
      (AC-8b.) Retains the notification message or banner on the screen until users acknowledge the usage conditions and take explicit actions to log on to or further access the information system; and 
      (AC-8c.) For publicly accessible systems: 
        (AC-8c.1.) Displays system use information [Assignment: organization-defined conditions], before granting further access; 
        (AC-8c.2.) Displays references, if any, to monitoring, recording, or auditing that are consistent with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally prohibit those activities; and 
        (AC-8c.3.) Includes a description of the authorized uses of the system.
