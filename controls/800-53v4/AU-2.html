<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:30px 0 8px 0;">Statement</h3>
<blockquote>
<pre>     The organization: 
      (AU-2a.) Determines that the information system is capable of auditing the following events: [Assignment: organization-defined auditable events]; 
      (AU-2b.) Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide the selection of auditable events; 
      (AU-2c.) Provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents; and 
      (AU-2d.) Determines that the following events are to be audited within the information system: [Assignment: organization-defined audited events (the subset of the auditable events defined in AU-2 a.) along with the frequency of (or situation requiring) auditing for each identified event].
