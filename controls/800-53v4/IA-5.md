<blockquote>
<pre>     The organization manages information system authenticators by: 
      (IA-5a.) Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, group, role, or device receiving the authenticator; 
      (IA-5b.) Establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators defined by the organization; 
      (IA-5c.) Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use; 
      (IA-5d.) Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators; 
      (IA-5e.) Changing default content of authenticators prior to information system installation; 
      (IA-5f.) Establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions for authenticators; 
      (IA-5g.) Changing/refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined time period by authenticator type]; 
      (IA-5h.) Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification; 
      (IA-5i.) Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific security safeguards to protect authenticators; and 
      (IA-5j.) Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.
