<blockquote>
<pre>     The organization: 
      (IR-8a.) Develops an incident response plan that: 
        (IR-8a.1.) Provides the organization with a roadmap for implementing its incident response capability; 
        (IR-8a.2.) Describes the structure and organization of the incident response capability; 
        (IR-8a.3.) Provides a high-level approach for how the incident response capability fits into the overall organization; 
        (IR-8a.4.) Meets the unique requirements of the organization, which relate to mission, size, structure, and functions; 
        (IR-8a.5.) Defines reportable incidents; 
        (IR-8a.6.) Provides metrics for measuring the incident response capability within the organization; 
        (IR-8a.7.) Defines the resources and management support needed to effectively maintain and mature an incident response capability; and 
        (IR-8a.8.) Is reviewed and approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]; 
      (IR-8b.) Distributes copies of the incident response plan to [Assignment: organization-defined incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements]; 
      (IR-8c.) Reviews the incident response plan [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; 
      (IR-8d.) Updates the incident response plan to address system/organizational changes or problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing; 
      (IR-8e.) Communicates incident response plan changes to [Assignment: organization-defined incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements]; and 
      (IR-8f.) Protects the incident response plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
