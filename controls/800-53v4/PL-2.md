        (PL-2a.2.) Explicitly defines the authorization boundary for the system; 
        (PL-2a.3.) Describes the operational context of the information system in terms of missions and business processes; 
        (PL-2a.4.) Provides the security categorization of the information system including supporting rationale; 
        (PL-2a.5.) Describes the operational environment for the information system and relationships with or connections to other information systems; 
        (PL-2a.6.) Provides an overview of the security requirements for the system; 
        (PL-2a.7.) Identifies any relevant overlays, if applicable; 
        (PL-2a.8.) Describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements including a rationale for the tailoring decisions; and

      (PL-2b.) Distributes copies of the security plan and communicates subsequent changes to the plan to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]; 
      (PL-2c.) Reviews the security plan for the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; 
      (PL-2d.) Updates the plan to address changes to the information system/environment of operation or problems identified during plan implementation or security control assessments; and
