<blockquote>
<pre>     The organization: 
      (PL-8a.) Develops an information security architecture for the information system that: 
        (PL-8a.1.) Describes the overall philosophy, requirements, and approach to be taken with regard to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information; 
        (PL-8a.2.) Describes how the information security architecture is integrated into and supports the enterprise architecture; and 
        (PL-8a.3.) Describes any information security assumptions about, and dependencies on, external services; 
      (PL-8b.) Reviews and updates the information security architecture [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to reflect updates in the enterprise architecture; and 
      (PL-8c.) Ensures that planned information security architecture changes are reflected in the security plan, the security Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and organizational procurements/acquisitions.
