        (PM-1a.2.) Includes the identification and assignment of roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; 
        (PM-1a.3.) Reflects coordination among organizational entities responsible for the different aspects of information security (i.e., technical, physical, personnel, cyber-physical); and 
        (PM-1a.4.) Is approved by a senior official with responsibility and accountability for the risk being incurred to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; 
      (PM-1b.) Reviews the organization-wide information security program plan [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];
