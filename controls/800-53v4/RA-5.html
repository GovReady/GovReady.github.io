<blockquote>
<pre>     The organization: 
      (RA-5a.) Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications [Assignment: organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are identified and reported; 
      (RA-5b.) Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for: 
        (RA-5b.1.) Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations; 
        (RA-5b.2.) Formatting checklists and test procedures; and 
        (RA-5b.3.) Measuring vulnerability impact; 
      (RA-5c.) Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments; 
      (RA-5d.) Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and 
      (RA-5e.) Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control assessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).
