<blockquote>
<pre>     The organization: 
      (SA-15a.) Requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to follow a documented development process that: 
        (SA-15a.1.) Explicitly addresses security requirements; 
        (SA-15a.2.) Identifies the standards and tools used in the development process; 
        (SA-15a.3.) Documents the specific tool options and tool configurations used in the development process; and 
        (SA-15a.4.) Documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools used in development; and 
      (SA-15b.) Reviews the development process, standards, tools, and tool options/configurations [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to determine if the process, standards, tools, and tool options/configurations selected and employed can satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined security requirements].
