      (SA-17a.) Is consistent with and supportive of the organization�s security architecture which is established within and is an integrated part of the organization�s enterprise architecture; 
      (SA-17b.) Accurately and completely describes the required security functionality, and the allocation of security controls among physical and logical components; and 
      (SA-17c.) Expresses how individual security functions, mechanisms, and services work together to provide required security capabilities and a unified approach to protection.
