<p class="text-danger">Failing to implement for DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN is of <b>HIGH</b> impact.</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:30px 0 8px 0;">Statement</h3>
<blockquote>
<pre>     The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to produce a design specification and security architecture that: 
      (SA-17a.) Is consistent with and supportive of the organization�s security architecture which is established within and is an integrated part of the organization�s enterprise architecture; 
      (SA-17b.) Accurately and completely describes the required security functionality, and the allocation of security controls among physical and logical components; and 
      (SA-17c.) Expresses how individual security functions, mechanisms, and services work together to provide required security capabilities and a unified approach to protection.
