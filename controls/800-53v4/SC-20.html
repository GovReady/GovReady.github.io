<p class="text-info">Failing to implement for SECURE NAME / ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE (AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE) is of <b>LOW</b> impact.</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:30px 0 8px 0;">Statement</h3>
<blockquote>
<pre>     The information system: 
      (SC-20a.) Provides additional data origin authentication and integrity verification artifacts along with the authoritative name resolution data the system returns in response to external name/address resolution queries; and 
      (SC-20b.) Provides the means to indicate the security status of child zones and (if the child supports secure resolution services) to enable verification of a chain of trust among parent and child domains, when operating as part of a distributed, hierarchical namespace.
