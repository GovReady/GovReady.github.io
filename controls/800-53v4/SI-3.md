<blockquote>
<pre>     The organization: 
      (SI-3a.) Employs malicious code protection mechanisms at information system entry and exit points to detect and eradicate malicious code; 
      (SI-3b.) Updates malicious code protection mechanisms whenever new releases are available in accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures; 
      (SI-3c.) Configures malicious code protection mechanisms to: 
        (SI-3c.1.) Perform periodic scans of the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and real-time scans of files from external sources at [Selection (one or more); endpoint; network entry/exit points] as the files are downloaded, opened, or executed in accordance with organizational security policy; and 
        (SI-3c.2.) [Selection (one or more): block malicious code; quarantine malicious code;  send alert to administrator; [Assignment: organization-defined action]] in response to malicious code detection; and 
      (SI-3d.) Addresses the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and the resulting potential impact on the availability of the information system.
